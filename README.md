#  Videogames Database (Push-based Architecture) 

This project was inspired by [this app](https://github.com/bobangajicsm/ng-video-games-db).

I have replicated the UI 1:1 but changed its architecture from a pull-based approach to a push-based approach.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.2.

## Getting Started Locally

- Obtain an API Key from https://rawg.io/apidocs
- copy `src/environments/environment.ts` into a new file `src/environments/environment.dev.ts` and add the API Key

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
